üì¶ Streamline Logistics Solutions ‚Äì Order Fulfillment Dashboard (Excel & Power BI)
## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and optimizing the order fulfillment process at Streamline Logistics Solutions, addressing challenges such as:

Mounting order backlogs

Lack of visibility into delivery status

Rising customer complaints

Escalating operational costs

Through data-driven insights using Excel and Power BI, this project provides an interactive dashboard to help stakeholders track key metrics, analyze performance, and make timely decisions.

üéØ Objectives
Reduce order delays and backlogs

Improve customer communication and satisfaction

Optimize delivery routes and driver performance

Identify and minimize operational inefficiencies

Provide real-time visibility into the fulfillment process

üìä Tools & Technologies

Tool	Purpose
Microsoft Excel	Data cleaning, pivot tables, slicers, delay analysis, and dashboard design
Microsoft Power BI	Interactive dashboard, advanced visualizations, performance metrics, predictive insights
üìÅ Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following fields:

Order ID: Unique identifier for each order

Delivery Address: Customer delivery address

Order Timestamp: Time when the order was placed

Order Status: Completed, In Progress, or Backlogged

Driver ID: Assigned driver

Vehicle Info: Delivery vehicle details

Current Location: Driver's current location

Delivery Time: Time taken to deliver (in minutes)

Delays: Delay in delivery (in minutes)

üìà Key Features of the Dashboards

Card Visuals for total orders, on-time %, delayed orders

Stacked Column Charts for delivery performance by driver

Line Charts to visualize delay trends across months

Map Visuals to track delivery addresses and locations

Scatter Plot showing the relationship between delays and delivery time

Calculated Columns for Delay Costs (Delays √ó Cost per Min)

Slicers for interactivity (Driver, Status, Region, etc.)

Customer Feedback Tracker (Positive vs. Negative visual)

üìå Insights & Recommendations

-The total number of deliveries processed in the evaluated week was 1500.

-3.07% of orders were delivered on time, while  96.93% experienced delays.

-The average delay time was 14.51 minutes, with the longest delays observed in Route 3, and also by Driver with ID D86.

-The visibility gap remains a challenge, with 35.27 of customers expressing dissatisfaction due to delayed updates on delivery statuses.

-Top Delayed Drivers/Regions: Identified for training or reassignment

-Delay Hotspots: Specific times or addresses with repeat delays

-Customer Communication Gap: Recommended real-time tracking system

-Operational Cost Impact: Estimated delay cost visualized using Delay √ó Rate

-Improvement Opportunities: Optimize driver allocation and route planning

üìÖ Future Enhancements
