📞 Call Center Performance Dashboard – Power BI
📌 Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of call center performance, including customer satisfaction, agent performance, and call trends. It helps identify bottlenecks, improve response times, and enhance customer experience.

🎯 Key Insights & Metrics
✔ Customer Satisfaction % – Measures overall satisfaction based on surveys & feedback.
✔ Total Calls Answered & Abandoned – Tracks agent efficiency & service quality.
✔ Average Speed of Answer – Evaluates response times.
✔ Call Trends (Hourly, Daily, Weekly, Monthly) – Identifies peak periods & workload distribution.
✔ Agent Leaderboard – Highlights top 5 performing agents based on key metrics.
✔ Call Topics & Resolution Rates – Analyzes issue types & resolution efficiency.

🛠 Techniques & Tricks Used in Power BI
📊 Data Modeling & Transformations
✅ Power Query Editor – Cleaned, transformed, and structured data for better insights.
✅ Custom Columns – Created calculated fields like Weekday, Hour of Call, and Resolution Status.
✅ Merged Queries – Combined multiple data sources to establish relationships.

📈 Visualization & UX Enhancements
✅ KPI Cards – Used to display key performance indicators (Satisfaction %, Calls Answered, etc.).
✅ Gauge Chart – Visualized customer satisfaction against a set target (e.g., 80%).
✅ Trend Line (Line Chart) – Showed satisfaction trends over time.
✅ Heatmap (Matrix Visual) – Displayed call trends by Day & Hour to detect peak periods.
✅ Scatter Plot (Agent Performance) – Used quadrant analysis to categorize agents into:

Top Performers (High Calls, Low Handle Time)

Efficiency Check Needed (High Calls, High Handle Time)

Potential Improvement (Low Calls, Low Handle Time)

Coaching Opportunity (Low Calls, High Handle Time)

🔍 Filters & Interactive Features
✅ Slicers – Enabled filtering by Date, Agent, Call Type, and Resolution Status.
✅ Drill-through Pages – Created a detailed Agent Performance View (Right-click → Drill-through).
✅ Conditional Formatting – Highlighted high abandoned call rates & poor customer satisfaction.
✅ Tooltips – Added insights when hovering over visual elements.
✅ Bookmark - To hide and display the slicers

🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) Measures
✅ Total Calls Answered:

DAX
Total Calls Answered = COUNTROWS(FILTER(CallData, CallData[Answered] = "Y"))
✅ Abandoned Call %:

DAX
Abandoned Call % = DIVIDE([Total Calls Abandoned], [Total Calls], 0)
✅ Average Speed of Answer:

DAX
Avg Speed of Answer = AVERAGE(CallData[Speed of Answer])
✅ Top 5 Agents (Leaderboard using Top N Filter):

Used Top N filter on -Resolved Calls (50%) → Higher is better.
                     -Customer Satisfaction % (30%) → Higher is better.
                     -Speed of Answer (20%) → Lower is better (so we reverse rank it).

📈 Key Insights
1️⃣ Customer Satisfaction & Call Volume
Customer Satisfaction = 55.19% (Needs improvement).

Total Calls Answered = 4054 | Calls Abandoned = 946 (18.92%)

Avg Speed of Answer = 54.75 sec (If too high, may lead to customer frustration).

2️⃣ Agent Performance (Top 5 Agents)
  Ranked based on    -Resolved Calls (50%)
                     -Customer Satisfaction % (30%)
                     -Speed of Answer (20%)
Top Agent: Dan (0.83 final score) | Lowest: Greg (0.45).

Performance gaps indicate the need for agent training and best practice sharing.

3️⃣ Resolution Analysis
Only 27% of issues are unresolved (1354 unresolved vs. 3646 resolved).

Common unresolved topics:

Streaming (73% resolved)

Technical Support (72% resolved)

Unresolved issues could be due to lack of expertise or poor ticket follow-ups.

4️⃣ Call Trends (Time & Day Analysis)
Peak hours: 10 AM - 5 PM (High call volume, needs more staff).

Monday sees the most calls (629) → Possible backlog from weekends.

🚀 Recommendations for Improvement
✅ Improve Call Resolution Rate:

Provide specialized agent training for unresolved topics (Streaming & Tech Support).

Introduce callback systems for unresolved queries.

Expand self-service resources to reduce unnecessary calls.

✅ Reduce Call Abandonment Rate:

Optimize IVR (Interactive Voice Response) for better call routing.

Ensure more agents are online during peak hours.

Implement chatbots or knowledge bases for faster resolutions.

✅ Enhance Agent Performance:

Conduct mentorship programs for lower-performing agents.

Introduce performance-based incentives to boost agent efficiency.

✅ Monitor CSAT Trends & Customer Feedback:

Investigate why CSAT % fluctuates and its correlation with unresolved calls.

Conduct customer surveys to improve service quality.
