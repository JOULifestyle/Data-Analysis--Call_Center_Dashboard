This contains some of my Data analysis projects.
Each project seperated in a different folder with its README.md
This repository showcases a collection of data analysis projects I've completed using tools like Power BI, Excel, SQL, and Python. Each project focuses on solving real-world business problems through data exploration, visualization, and actionable insights. From customer behavior and sales trends to supply chain and logistics optimization.
